					<h2>The opposite sides of a die will always add up to seven.</h2>
					<p>If you take a look, you'll see that one and six are on opposite sides of the cube (1+6=7), as are two and five (2+5=7), and three and four (3+4=7).</p>

					<h2>If you open your eyes in a pitch-black room, the color you'll see is called "eigengrau."</h2>
					<p>Go into the darkest room that you can find, one where there's no light at all, and spend a few minutes with your eyes closed. Then, open them up and take a look around. While you'd expect to be staring into pitch-blackness, you'll actually notice that you're seeing a sort of dark gray shade. And that color has a name: It's called "eigengrau."</p>

					<h2>The infinity sign is called a lemniscate.</h2>
					<p>If you were to draw an infinity sign, you would create a sort of figure-eight that looped in a continuous, unbroken line. You could also say that you're sketching out a lemniscate, which is another word for the infinity sign and means "decorated with ribbons" in Latin.</p>
